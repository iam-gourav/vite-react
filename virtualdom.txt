Virtual DOM , Fiber and reconcilliation

main.jsx 
createRoot method

browser create DOM tree structure 
createRoot create DOM like structure not real is called virtual DOM

when we update something in html browser remove all DOM tree and repaint or regenerate DOM it's called page reloading.
but in react virtual DOM is created and compare with browser DOM it updates only those elements 
who made changes or updated.

the process of updating DOM element by virtual DOM the algorithem which is used behind this process is called fiber.
